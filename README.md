Supermarket Management System is created using Python to easily manage all supermarket related functions by a single user. As a terminal application, the users are able to perform basic operations of their supermarket such as additional items, view items, clear items/stocks, purchase items, search for specific products in the stocks and edit any items/products placed in the system record. Supermarket Management System also facilitates users to add new products in their stocks as a sale. This function includes adding items with their name, quantity(along with validation), and price of the item. Users can also see all the items stores in the system. The program shows the number of items along with their name, quantity, and price.
